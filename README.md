cityTIPs is a trip itinerary planner application designed to aggregate information from popular rating websites such as Yelp, Eventbrite and Foursquare to help users plan their their trips and give them suggestions on what all they can do on their trip. Currently, market factors suggest that there is a need for an aggregator of information across the web to provide consumers with the most consolidated list of popular tourist attractions. cityTIPs plans to acquire users through multiple online and print advertising channels, as well as through social media trends. Ultimately, we have created an application that will simplify trip planning by bringing all of the best recommendations together.
